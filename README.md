# cancer-detection-using-Naive-bayes-probablistic-approach
Probablistic approach is used to determine whether the cell is cancerous or not.It uses the concept of apriori probablity and conditional probability.
The program divides the dataset into training and test dataset accoring to the offset and fold length. Training dataset is used to train the data using probability upon which test data is tested.

Dataset is taken from UCI repository.
This program works on python3.
